					<p>I'm 20 years old student of KROK University. I'm studying programming for 3 years on Python: at this moment I already have 3 projects done with my team. Also tried such languages as C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript and Lua.</p>
					<p>The best for me is Python, of course - it's easy to learn, has many interesting modules and it's very reliable!</p>
					<p>I also like playing games like DotA 2 with my friends, spend time in huge companies and drink beer.</p>

					<p>I'm very inspired for going through this course. It taught me a lot of hard C language, some sweetty Python, Flask and Jinja, and of course some intresting web things. I'm grateful to SoftServe and Harvard for taking me through this all wonderful moments!</p>

					<p>Among other things in my life, I think Dota is the best thing that happened to me. This game changed my whole life, and my friend's life too a bit. But I proud playing this game - Dota is not a game iself, it's a life style.</p>
